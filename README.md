# ScalaTraining
Repo to organize and follow a self-organized Scala training with some collegues 

This repo is organized by day of study group.

Each day contains:

- agenda.md
- a list of scala files for the drills.

Each scala file contains the exercises with the API and the description of it.

Each agenda should contain:

1. Subject Presentation
2. Activity/Problems presentation
3. Group work
4. Discussion

### Two GREAT Cheet Sheets that is a MUST HAVE on the Scala training 

I was having doubts about creating one, but there are already great resources, please check:

* [The official one](http://docs.scala-lang.org/cheatsheets/)

* [A really good one in Github](https://github.com/lampepfl/progfun-wiki/blob/gh-pages/CheatSheet.md)
