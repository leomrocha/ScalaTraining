  //Write a function for Factorial in an imperative way
  //Write the test for it too under the src/test/scala directory

  //Exercise 2.a
  //Write a function for Factorial in a recursive way, try to make it tail recursive
  //Write the test for it too under the src/test/scala directory

  //Exercise 3
  //Write a Fibonacci function in an imperative way
  //The function must find the Nth Fibonacci Element
  //Write the test for it too under the src/test/scala directory
